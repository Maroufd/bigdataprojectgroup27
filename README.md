# About our Project

The objective of this work is to help students to put into practice the concepts learnt during the
theory lessons, and to get proficiency in the use of Spark and other related Big Data
technologies. In this exercise, the students are required to develop a Spark application that
creates a machine learning model for a real-world problem, using real-world data: Predicting the
arrival delay of commercial flights.


# Installation
We recommend Docker because it works on all operating systems.
